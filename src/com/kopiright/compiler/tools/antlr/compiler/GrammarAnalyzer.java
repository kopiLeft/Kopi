 * There should be no distinction between static & dynamic analysis.
 * In other words, some of the easy analysis can be done statically
 * and then the part that is hard statically can be deferred to
 * parse-time.  Interestingly, computing LL(k) for k>1 lookahead
 * statically is O(|T|^k) where T is the grammar vocabulary, but,
 * is O(k) at run-time (ignoring the large constant associated with
 * the size of the grammar).  In English, the difference can be
 * described as "find the set of all possible k-sequences of input"
 * versus "does this specific k-sequence match?".
