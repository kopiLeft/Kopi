**** To verify ******
When I add a block (in split critical edge), if the next block 
is protected by an exception, the block added must be also protected.
Verify if it's done.


**** To see   *******
- Maybe, it can be useful to add an affectation of a protected variable
  before the protected region to reduce the live of this variable

- Instruction move can be improve (in Propagator for example) : an instruction
  which can throw an exception can be move after (or before) an assignment, 
  if the variable defined is not used in a phi-catch.

- When I take the parameter number in InvokeinterfaceInstruction, I have
  an error when generated 3-address instructions.

**** To Do  ********
- It is possible that a sub-routine in the code JVM is never called. So 
  during the generation, I don't know that is a sub-routine. The first instruction
  is a store and there is an error during the generation of 3-address code for
  this basic block. This case must be detected (the basic block is not reachable).
- When removing a basic block, remove it from all ExceptionHandler.
- findSubRoutine of ControlFlowGraph must not be public
- In some case, I concider that the operands of a phi function are
  QSSAVar, but it could be a QConstant. Find this, and add a test

**** To improve ****
- hasOperand in QPhiCatch
- toString of jumps, jsr, QDeclaredInitialized, QConstant.
- Improve the order of the conditions in QuadrupleGenerator or put
  two big switchs.
