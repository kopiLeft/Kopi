OTHER PACKAGES YOU WILL NEED

    JDK 1.4 or higher

    GNU GETOPT
	The parsing of the arguments of the command line is made with gnu.getopt :
	http://www.urbanophile.com/arenn/hacking/download.html

    JFLEX
	The lexical analysers are generated with JFlex :
	http://www.jflex.de

    IBM BIGDECIMAL CLASSES
	An improved implementation of the java.math package (XKOPI only) :
	http://www2.hursley.ibm.com/decimal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING FROM SOURCE

    You will need GNU make.

    Define an environment variable CLASSROOT to an existing directory in your
    file hierarchy  this is where the generated class files will be stored.
    Don't forget to include this directory in your CLASSPATH.

    You will need a working Java compiler to build Kopi from source. You may need
    to edit the Makefile in this directory if the Java compiler available on your
    system is not Jikes.

    Then just go to the "src/com/kopiright" directory and type "make".
